*The Empathetic Code Reviewer in action - transforming harsh feedback into constructive guidance*

## 🌟 Features

### Core Functionality
- **JSON Input Processing**: Accepts code snippets and review comments in structured format
- **AI-Powered Transformation**: Uses GPT-4 to transform critical feedback into constructive guidance
- **Structured Output**: Generates well-formatted Markdown reports with three key sections per comment:
  - **Positive Rephrasing**: Encouraging, supportive version of the original feedback
  - **The 'Why'**: Clear technical explanations of underlying software principles
  - **Suggested Improvement**: Concrete code examples demonstrating fixes

### Advanced Features
- **🎯 Contextual Awareness**: Adjusts AI tone based on the severity of original comments
- **📚 Smart Resource Links**: Automatically includes relevant documentation links (PEP 8, performance guides, etc.)
- **📋 Holistic Summary**: Provides encouraging overall assessment of code and developer progress
- **🔍 Real-time Validation**: Live JSON validation and preview of parsed data
- **💾 Export Functionality**: Download generated reports as Markdown files

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this project**
   ```bash
   cd Dwarix_AI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 1. API Key Setup
- Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar (securely handled, not stored)
- Alternatively, create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`

### 2. Input Format
The application expects JSON input with two keys:

```json
{
  "code_snippet": "def get_active_users(users):\n    results = []\n    for u in users:\n        if u.is_active == True and u.profile_complete == True:\n            results.append(u)\n    return results",
  "review_comments": [
    "This is inefficient. Don't loop twice conceptually.",
    "Variable 'u' is a bad name.",
    "Boolean comparison '== True' is redundant."
  ]
}
```

### 3. Generate Review
1. Click "📋 Load Example Data" to try the provided hackathon example
2. Or paste your own JSON input
3. Click "🚀 Generate Empathetic Review"
4. View the transformed feedback in the output panel
5. Download the report as a Markdown file if needed

## 📊 Example Output

For the input above, the tool generates empathetic feedback like:

```markdown
### Analysis of Comment: "This is inefficient. Don't loop twice conceptually."

**Positive Rephrasing:** Great start on the logic here! For better performance, especially with large user lists, we can make this more efficient by combining the checks.

**The 'Why':** Iterating through a list and performing checks can become slow as the list grows. By using more direct methods like list comprehensions, we can often achieve the same result with cleaner and faster code.

**Suggested Improvement:**
```python
def get_active_users(users):
    return [user for user in users if user.is_active and user.profile_complete]
```
